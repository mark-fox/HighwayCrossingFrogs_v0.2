# HighwayCrossingFrogs_v0.2

## Description:
This project is a simple game created with Unreal Engine. The game involves a player controlling a vehicle down a highway that is littered with exploding frogs. As the player encounters one of these frogs, they receive a point that is added to their accumulated total. A timer is displayed showing the current time within the game.
I was inspired to make a game that took the classic arcade game, Frogger, and spin it around so the player is a vehicle and aiming to hit the frog character. The map is a continuous course that spawns more roads as the player continues down the course.
